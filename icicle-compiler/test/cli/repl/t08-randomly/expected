## Check error

  Cannot discharge constraints at 1:35
  
    1:35  Conflicting let temporalities.
          This kind of let isn't allowed because its definition could never be used.
          The definition is a Aggregate, while the body is a Element.

## Check error

  Cannot discharge constraints at 1:19
  
    1:19  Cannot unify: Sum check-5 check-3
          With type:    Sum check-9 (Sum check-5 check-3)
          These types were required to be equal, but are not.
