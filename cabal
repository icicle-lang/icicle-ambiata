Commands:
    build           Build this project, including all executables and test suites.
    test            Test this project, by default this runs all test suites.
    repl            Start the repl, by default on the the main library source.
    quick           Start the repl directly skipping cabal, this is useful developing
                    across multiple source trees at once.
    demo            If this project has a demo application, this builds and runs it.
    exec            If this project has an executable, this builds and runs it.
    tags            Generate tags for this project.
    lint            Lint the project.
    init            Start a new project.
    update          Cabal update, but limited to retrieving at most once per day.
